Hey there, thank you for stopping by and taking a look at my portfolio site.

## Setup, Server and Deployment

    cd lennonzf.github.io
    bundle install
    bower install

    middleman server

## The Site
**Site**: [http://lennonzf.com/](http://lennonzf.com/)

**GP Pages Link**: [https://lennonzf.github.io/](https://lennonzf.github.io/)

##### Under Development
My site is continuously developed and maintianed by myself.

##### Motivation
This is the second iteration for my personal portfolio site. Back in time, when I was building my first site, I haven't quite mastered all the skills required to build a site. Therefore, my first site was built based on a Bootstrap template named [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/).

By learning and practicing more, I feel it's the right time to build a new site from scratch with a bunch of handy techs. Also, I am aiming to make a shift from an **aesthetic focus** desginer to a proper **User Experience** oriented designer. So, here goes the new site you are seeing now.

##### Goal
By designing and coding up the site, I am aiming for these goals:

- [x] Design a portfolio site with a focus on demonstrating my UX skills
- [x] Practice minimal design
- [x] Refresh my visual identity (e.g. logo)
- [x] Build a site from scratch
- [x] Get familiar with website building process from desgin to deployment
- [x] Learn and use Middleman
- [x] Learn and use Github and Github Pages
- [x] Learn and use Flexbox
- [x] Practice SASS with SCSS syntax and functional CSS
- [x] Develop a style guide
- [x] ~~Add an automated testing tool~~ Use hound for reviewing pull requests (mainly HAML and SCSS) and act on the comments
- [x] Use Bower for managing the front-end plugins
- [x] Add proper social media metadata to enhance the SEO of the site
- [x] Start using Github as a project management tool
- [x] Learn to create custom helper function in Middleman
- [x] Learn to use partials, layout and data in Middleman

##### Special Thanks
Special Thanks to **[Felix Lee](http://felixlee.io/)**, who inspired and encouraged me to build the site; **[Kian Zhu](http://kianzyk.site/)**, who provided a huge amount of feedback and patience to me.

## Stylesheet
The stylesheets of this site follows the spirit of [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) (Scalable and Modular Architecture of CSS). By using the structure, lines of CSS can be kept at a minimal number. The ability to reuse the classes increase the flexibility as well as maintainability.
