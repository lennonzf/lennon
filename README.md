# Portfolio Site
Hey there, thank you for stopping by and taking a look at my portfolio site.

## The Site
**GP Pages Link**: [https://lennonzf.github.io/](https://lennonzf.github.io/)

##### Site in Development
My site is still under **development** and is temporarily hosted by Github Pages.

##### Motivation
This is the second iteration for my personal portfolio site. Back in time, when I was building my first site (still hosting at [here](http://lennonzf.com/) at the moment), I haven't quite mastered all the skills required to build a site. Therefore, my first site was built based on a Bootstrap template named [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/).

By learning and practicing more, I feel it's the right time to build a new site from scratch with a bunch of handy techs. Also, I am aiming to make a shift from an **aesthetic focus** desginer to a proper **User Experience** oriented designer. So, here goes the new site you are seeing now.

##### Goal
By designing and coding up the site, I am aiming for these goals:

- Design a portfolio site with a focus on demonstrating my UX skills
- Practice minimal design
- Refresh my visual identity (e.g. logo)
- Build a site from scratch
- Get familiar with website building process from desgin to deployment
- Learn and use Middleman
- Learn and use Github and Github Pages
- Learn and use Flexbox
- Practice SASS with SCSS syntax and functional CSS
- Develop a style guide
- ~~Add an automated testing tool~~ Use [hound](https://houndci.com/) for reviewing pull requests (mainly HAML and SCSS) and act on the comments

#####Special Thanks
Special Thanks to **[Felix Lee](http://felixlee.io/)**, who inspired and encouraged me to build the site; **Kian Zhu**, who provided a huge amount of feedback and patience to me.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- Github & [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - version control and hosting the development site
- [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) - building and deploying the site
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and SCSS Syntax - stylesheet preprocessor

## Stylesheet
The stylesheets of this site follows the spirit of [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) (Scalable and Modular Architecture of CSS). By using the structure, lines of CSS can be kept at a minimal number. The ability to reuse the classes increase the flexibility as well as maintainability.

The stylesheets in this project is created collaboratively by **[Felix Lee](http://felixlee.io/)** and myself.
