      %h2 Intro
      %p As my team at NetEngine was reaching to the delivery point of the MVP product for a ruby on rails application named Senza Carta, I was involved in designing and developing a landing page for the product.

      %h3 Client
      %p Senza Carta aims to bring a new digital employee experience for Human Resources in business and individual job seekers.

      %h3 Challenge
      %p I was asked to continue iterating the design based on my team member’s initial work. My client also wants to see some illustrations on the site.

      .c1in2.sm-c1in1.lg-p2.md-p2.sm-mt4
        %p 
          What the client wanted was simple in the initial stage, be on brand and be clean. The landing page of
          = link_to 'Facebook Workplace', '//workplace.fb.com/', target: 'auto'
          and NetEngine’s in house project 
          = link_to 'Cloudbill', '//cloudbill.io/', target: 'auto'
          were given as example.

        %p
          The team was only provided with a logo and some content from client’s pitch deck.

  .container.max-w600px
    %p Here’s the initial design:

  .container.max-w900px
    = image_tag '/assets/images/projects/senza-carta/design_v1.png'

  .container.max-w600px
    %p The client made some comments:
    %ul
      %li Not fond of the liberty we took with changing the logo
      %li More distinctive color to separate different sections of the page (the current grey color is too light)
      %li The page needs to be divided into two categories, for individual and for business. Each category has its own content.
      %li Require some illustrations for the individual page to target the demographic of a younger generation
      %li Would like to see more product mockup images in the page
      %li 
        New example: 
        = link_to "deputy’s feature page", "//www.deputy.com/features", target: "auto"
