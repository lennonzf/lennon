      %h2.light.text-blue Intro
      %p At the beginning of 2016, I got the change to work individually on NetEngineâ€™s first user experience project. It was also the first time for myself to see a UX project all the way from proposal to final delivery.

      %h3.light.text-grey-dark Client
      %p Smart Clinics is a network of family medical centers, whose aim is to make General Practitioners (GP) appointments a more positive experience.

      %h3.light.text-grey-dark Problem
      %p
        Smart Clinics would like to improve the
        %u conversion rate
        of their current online booking form.
