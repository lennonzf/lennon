      %h2 Intro
      %p At the beginning of 2016, I got the change to work individually on NetEngine’s first user experience project. It was also the first time for myself to see a UX project all the way from proposal to final delivery.

      %h3 Client
      %p Smart Clinics is a network of family medical centers, whose aim is to make General Practitioners (GP) appointments a more positive experience.

      %h3 Problem
      %p
        Smart Clinics would like to improve the
        %u conversion rate
        of their current online booking form.

    .mb9
      %h2 Plan
      %p
        I created a 7-day proposal for the project:
      %ul
        %li Day 1: Understand the Product
        %li Day 2: Usability Testing
        %li Day 3: Find the Problem
        %li Day 4 - Day 7: Redesign

      %h2 Process

      .mb6
        %h3 Day 1: Understand the Product
        %p
          I haven’t exactly worked on a similar task before, especially with the terminology
          %u conversion rate
          \. One thing I know is that the better I could make the user experience of the form, the higher conversion rate the form can possibly get.

        %p
          The first thing I did was to understand the booking form by going through the process and mapping them out. The whole process includes 7 different steps (labeled as S1 to S7), along with 2 intermediate steps.

        = image_tag '/assets/images/projects/smartclinics/current_process.png'

        %p
          Along with this process, I took down some notes and created a list of obvious problems, issues and some suggestions based on my understanding of the product.

        %p
          With the list bearing in my mind, I pitched an ideal version of the process. The new process mapping was treated as a combination of my arrogant assumptions, which were later challenged by the usability testing session.

        %h3 Day 2: Usability Testing
        .mb6
          %h4 A. Design
          %p
            Before inviting the users to the office, I carefully designed the usability testing session based on what I have learnt from uni. I had never conducted a usability test in the real business world at this point. 

          %p
            I read a bunch of articles from 
            = link_to 'A list apart', 'http://alistapart.com/'
            \. There was this article (sadly, I lost the track of the link) making analysis on people’s 
            %u reacting time and emotion 
            upon different tasks really caught my attention. I thought why not experimenting these in my first session.

          %p
            Here’s a sneak peek at the design:

          %ul
            %li Filling out a personal information and a privacy consent form
            %li First Round: Participants were asked to picture themselves as a patient and go ahead use the form to book an appointment fitting their needs; time spent and emotion expressed for each step will be recorded
            %li Second Round: Participants were asked to perform some more specific tasks under instructions
            %li Participants were asked to provide more feedback and suggestions in addition to the previous two rounds of testing

          %h4 B. Testing

          %p
            Here are some interesting statistics:
          %ul
            %li 
              %u 17 
              participants were invited over for the testing session
            %li 
              I spent 
              %u a whole day 
              just doing the testing
            %li 
              The notes I took covered 
              %u 26 double-sided 
              A4 paper
            %li 
              Over 
              %u 70% 
              of the participants book a GP consultation over the phone with the reception of clinics
            %li 
              Only 
              %u 2 out of the 17 participants 
              make bookings either through an app on the mobile phone or a website
