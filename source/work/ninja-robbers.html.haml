      %p For the final semester of my uni, I finally had a chance to work on something with real fun, a multi-device party game - Ninja Robbers. I was mainly responsible for User Interface, overall visual style and web design/development for the Unity game. Although it was a first time experience for me to crack on the design aspect of a game, I did enjoy creating a lot of graphics and pushing my limits.
